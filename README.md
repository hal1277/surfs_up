# Surfs Up

## Overview

We are looking to open a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii with investment from W. Avey.  W. Avey's main concern before investing is the year round viability of the business and thinks weather is the key factor that affects the business so he has asked for some analysis to be done on the weather data for the area.  

## Results

At the request of W. Avey temperature data for the months of June and December were analyzed for Oahu.  

June Data:

|       | temperature |
|------:|------------:|
| count | 1700.000000 |
|  mean |   74.944118 |
|   std |    3.257417 |
|   min |   64.000000 |
|   25% |   73.000000 |
|   50% |   75.000000 |
|   75% |   77.000000 |
|   max |   85.000000 |

December Data:

|       | temperature |
|------:|------------:|
| count | 1517.000000 |
|  mean |   71.041529 |
|   std |    3.745920 |
|   min |   56.000000 |
|   25% |   69.000000 |
|   50% |   71.000000 |
|   75% |   74.000000 |
|   max |   83.000000 |

Based on the summary temperature data for the months of June and December seen above we can observe several things:

    - the minimum temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than in June
    - the variation in temperature (standard deviation) is a little higher in December than June
    - the maximum temperatures in both months are similar
    - the mean temperature is a little higher in June (4 degrees)


## Summary

Based on the temperature data analysis it would appear that the busines could be viable year round becuase there is not a large change in the temperature between June and December.  However, temperature is only one element of weather that could affect the business.  Other aspects of the weather should be queried as well to get a more complete picture of how weather could affect the business.  The preciptiation should definitely be queried as well for those months.  Other weather factors that could affect the business and should also be queried include the amount of sun/cloud and the wind conditions.  As well if the data is available wave conditions would also be very helpful to analyze as surfers would be very focused on that when deciding when and where to plan a surf trip.
